# PianoPlayer
Garry's Mod Auto Piano Player


My first C++ project!



# HOW TO USE
Drag a song from the songs folder onto PianoPlayer.exe
NUMPAD1 to start the song
NUMPAD2 to stop the song
NUMPAD3 to close the program
(If keybinds don't work make sure you have num lock on!)



# TODO
☐ Allow multiple keys to be played at once (Right now it just plays every one in a group really fast)

☐ GUI

☐ Transposition (Move keys up or down in pitch)
