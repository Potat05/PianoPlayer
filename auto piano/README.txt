To open a song file just drag it onto PianoPlayer.exe and if it is loaded it should say

Song file help
================== SONG FILE START ==================
name
discription
delay1 (Delay for anything that isnt ' ' or '|' but no delay if ' ' or '|' is ahead)
delay2 (Delay for ' ')
delay3 (Delay for '|')
keyTime (The amount of time the key is pressed *Keep this above 0 if you want it to work for Garry's Mod*)
SongNotes (The notes in the song *'[]' is played together*)
=================== SONG FILE END ===================


If you are taking songs from https://virtualpiano.net/ make sure to use https://removelinebreaks.net/ and set line breaks to none, or else the song delays wont be correct!

First delay is for every character other than ' ' & '|' but no delay is applied if ' ' or '|' is ahead
Second delay is only for ' '
Third delay is only for '|'
'[]' in notes is played together
Key time must be greater than 0 if you want it to work with Garry's Mod
